/* 
    SO lets talk about middlewares -
    they have the acceses to our Request object and response object.. and application - request response cycle -> next.
    - they can execute the code.
    -can make changes in the req res objectn and can end the application req-res cycle.
    next() function is not a part of NOde.js or Express API, its just a third argument passed in the middleware function
